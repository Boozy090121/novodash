# Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Lot-Based Analysis

This extension provides comprehensive lot-based analysis for pharmaceutical manufacturing data, integrating information from three distinct record types to produce actionable insights and recommendations.

## Overview

The analysis engine processes three types of records:

1. **Process Metrics Records** (Commercial Process_Yes/No) - Contains timeline, cycle time, and production metrics
2. **Internal RFT Records** (Internal RFT_*) - Quality issues documented in internal forms
3. **External RFT Records** (External RFT_*) - Feedback from external reviewers

The data is grouped by lot/batch number, and comprehensive analysis is performed at the lot level.

## Features

- **Lot-level integration** of process metrics, internal quality issues, and external feedback
- **RFT (Right First Time) analysis** considering all record types
- **Cycle time analysis** identifying critical path and bottlenecks
- **Error analysis** including categorization by type, form, reviewer, and location
- **Risk scoring** for each lot based on quality and process metrics
- **Actionable insights** with prioritized recommendations
- **Comparative metrics** across all lots

## Setup Instructions

### Automatic Setup

1. Open your dashboard page
2. Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
3. Copy and paste the contents of `add-lot-analysis.js` into the console
4. Press Enter to execute

The scripts will be added to the page automatically, and analysis will begin.

### Manual Setup

Alternatively, you can add the scripts directly to your HTML file:

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor
2. Add the following script tags before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="pharmaceutical-lot-analysis.js"></script>
<script src="integrate-lot-analysis.js"></script>
```

3. Save the file and reload the page

## Using the Analysis

1. Load your data using the dashboard's existing data loading mechanism
2. Navigate to the "Lot Analysis" tab that is added to the dashboard
3. View the overall metrics, insights, and recommendations
4. Use the lot selector to view detailed analysis for specific lots

## Analysis Components

### Overall Metrics

- Total lots analyzed
- Lot RFT rate
- Average cycle time
- Average errors per lot

### Insights

The analysis generates insights based on the data, including:

- Overall RFT performance
- Cycle time metrics and bottlenecks
- Most common error types
- Review process efficiency
- High-risk lots

### Recommendations

Actionable recommendations are generated with concrete steps to address issues, prioritized by impact:

- Quality improvement actions
- Process efficiency optimizations
- Documentation improvements
- Risk management strategies

### Lot Details

For each lot, you can view:

- Process metrics and critical path analysis
- Internal quality issues grouped by type and form
- External feedback categorized by issue type and stage
- Risk score and analysis

## Files

- `pharmaceutical-lot-analysis.js` - Main analysis engine
- `integrate-lot-analysis.js` - UI integration and visualization
- `add-lot-analysis.js` - Helper script for dynamic integration
- `LOT-ANALYSIS-README.md` - This documentation file

## Technical Implementation

The implementation is designed to integrate with any existing dashboard without modifying the core code. It:

1. Auto-detects when data is available
2. Groups records by lot identifier
3. Processes the three record types with specialized logic
4. Groups error types, feedback categories, and other metrics
5. Generates insights and recommendations based on patterns in the data
6. Creates a new UI tab with visualizations and lot details

## Customization

The analysis can be customized by modifying thresholds in the code:

- Risk scoring thresholds in `evaluateLot()` function
- Cycle time benchmarks in `evaluateLot()` function
- Insight severity levels in `generateInsights()` function
- Recommendation priorities in `generateRecommendations()` function

## Troubleshooting

If the analysis tab doesn't appear:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify that the data has been loaded properly
3. Try refreshing the page and loading the data again
4. Ensure all required files are in the same directory

## Advanced Analysis Notes

### Process Clarification Exception

External feedback categorized as "Process Clarification" is not counted as a failure for RFT status, as these are typically informational requests rather than quality issues.

### Critical Path Calculation

The critical path calculation identifies the longest cycle times in the manufacturing process, focusing on activities that contribute most to the overall cycle time.

### Risk Score Calculation

Risk scores are calculated using a weighted formula that considers:
- RFT status (pass/fail)
- Total cycle time
- Internal error count
- External issue count

Higher scores indicate higher risk and are categorized as:
- Low: 0-29
- Medium: 30-59
- High: 60-100
